# YouTube_Ratings_Preview
A chrome browser extension that shows YouTube video ratings next to the thumbnail.

## Installation

Not on the chrome web store (yet) so in order to use this extension you have to go to the extensions panel -> enable developer mode -> load unpacked -> open folder WITH manifest.json

Unfortunately, chome is a lil' ***** so unfortunately you'll be prompted to disable developer mode extensions every time you boot up chrome. Just click the little x to make it disappear.

## Settings panel

This extension's appearence and function is customizable. For help, [see the wiki](https://github.com/KeinR/YouTube_Ratings_Preview/wiki/customization)
